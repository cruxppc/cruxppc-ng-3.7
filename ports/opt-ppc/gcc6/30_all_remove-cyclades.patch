Subject: [PATCH] libsanitizer: Remove cyclades inclusion in sanitizer

The Linux kernel has removed the interface to cyclades from
the latest kernel headers[1] due to them being orphaned for the
past 13 years.

libsanitizer uses this header when compiling against glibc, but
glibcs itself doesn't seem to have any references to cyclades.

Further more it seems that the driver is broken in the kernel and
the firmware doesn't seem to be available anymore.

As such since this is breaking the build of libsanitizer (and so the
GCC bootstrap[2]) I propose to remove this.
